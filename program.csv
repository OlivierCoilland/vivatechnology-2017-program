There’s no question that innovation is driving massive change in the tech, media and telecoms space. But how do you turn innovative ideas into real-world applications? As industries converge, it’s no longer about “make” vs “buy”. Leading companies need to be innovators of business models while selectively leveraging venture-backed targets as strategic infusions of capability. Only then will TMT companies be able to capitalize on convergence and turn it into sustainable growth.

Personal and logistical mobility are a key to the cultural, social and economic life of a city, delivering huge benefits and equally huge externalities. New tech are converging to revolutionize the way people, good and services move through the urban landscape, requesting changes in legal, planning, architectural, regulatory and energy solutions. Who will win the battle for city transport – drivers, business, government, cyclists or pedestrians? Who will be their alliances? Who will be in the driver’s seat and who will own the vehicle? Who’s liable when there’s an accident? Who pays for the infrastructure, and who pays for the ride? We’ll explore the players, motivations and the tech intersecting in this future transport ecosystem and identify where convergence can create new opportunity.

Personal and logistical mobility are a key to the cultural, social and economic life of a city, delivering huge benefits and equally huge externalities. New tech are converging to revolutionize the way people, good and services move through the urban landscape, requesting changes in legal, planning, architectural, regulatory and energy solutions. Who will win the battle for city transport – drivers, business, government, cyclists or pedestrians? Who will be their alliances? Who will be in the driver’s seat and who will own the vehicle? Who’s liable when there’s an accident? Who pays for the infrastructure, and who pays for the ride? We’ll explore the players, motivations and the tech intersecting in this future transport ecosystem and identify where convergence can create new opportunity.

Saturday,"Femmes, Fintech & Success Stories","Dans la finance comme dans le numérique, les femmes restent sous-représentées. Un constat qui s’accentue lorsque l’on conjugue les deux activités. 
Alors que la mixité est un levier de performance, la Fintech peine à se féminiser, notamment au niveau des postes de direction.  
Alors comment s’imposer dans un milieu encore majoritairement masculin ? Quels sont les freins internes et externes à lever ? 
Nous mettrons en lumière les parcours de quatre femmes qui comptent dans le secteur de la Fintech et ouvrent ainsi la voie aux nouvelles générations.
